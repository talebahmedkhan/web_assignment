    <h1>What Is cryptocurrency</h1>
    <p>
      A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
      cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
      double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on
      blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network
      of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are
      generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them
      theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

    <h3>Blockchain</h3>
    <p>
      Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other
      cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates,
      blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks or an online ledger.
      Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently
      verified by each member of the network.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency. An anonymous
      person called Satoshi Nakamoto invented it and introduced it to the world
      via a white paper in 2008. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies present
      in the market today. Each cryptocurrency claims to have a different
      function and specification. For example, Ethereum's ether markets itself
      as gas for the underlying smart contract platform. Ripple's XRP is used by
      banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies. Bitcoin,
      which was made available to the public in 2009, remains the most widely
      traded and covered cryptocurrency. As of May 2022, there were over 19
      million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $576
      billion. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. 3 In the wake of
      Bitcoin's success, many other cryptocurrencies, known as "altcoins," have
      been launched. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others
      are new currencies that were built from scratch. They include Solana,
      Litecoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. By November 2021, the aggregate
      value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence had reached over $2.1
      trillion—Bitcoin represented approximately 41% of that total value. 4

    <h3>The Crypto Market</h3>
    <p>
      The total worth of the cryptocurrency market as of May 2021 is a whopping
      $1.7 trillion. There are over 10,000 listed cryptocurrencies at the time
      of writing, and this number is only bound to increase. Out of this,
      Bitcoin has the largest share in terms of market capitalisation, amounting
      to about $650 billion, followed by Ethereum and Tether. Acceptance of
      cryptocurrency around the world has been on the increase for many years
      now. For example, when a major US online retailer – Overstock.com –
      started accepting Bitcoins in 2014, it made $124,000 in Bitcoin sales on
      the first day itself. More interestingly, corporations are also
      recognising the investment value of this digital asset – US-based
      MicroStrategy Inc. purchased more than $1 billion of Bitcoin in 2020

    <h3>Why Invest in Bitcoin?</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to being highly secure in nature, Bitcoin is also peer-to-peer
      (P2P), which means it involves no intermediary (such as a bank or credit
      card agency) and offers a minimal transaction cost. It is fast and fully
      transparent – for instance, every Bitcoin transaction you make is recorded
      in a public ledger that is visible to all. It cannot be forged or
      counterfeited. Blockchain transactions are also irreversible, making the
      chances of fraudulent activities even smaller and your investments much
      more secure. You can trade Bitcoin through exchanges such as WazirX, which
      are a safe and secure platform for investors.
    </p>

    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>
      With cryptocurrency, the future is here. To start investing, you need a
      trusted cryptocurrency exchange such as WazirX where you can buy, sell and
      trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, and more.
