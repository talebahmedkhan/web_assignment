    <h1>What Is Web Development </h1>
    <p>Web development is the way toward building websites and applications for the web or a private network known as
        an intranet. Web development it's focused on the coding and programming that controls the website's
        functionality.
        From the most basic, static site pages to social media platforms and applications, from e-commerce sites to
        content management system (CMS); web developers have developed every tool we use via the internet.Web
        Development is primarily categorized into Front-end development and Back-end development. </p>
    <h2>Front-end </h2>
    <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
        challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of
        a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
    </p>
    <h2>Back-end </h2>
    <P>Back-end development refers to the development of server-side logic that powers websites and apps from behind the
        scenes. It includes all the code needed to build out the database, server, and application. From database
        migrations to API integrations to setting up the server-side technologies that make a website tick, a back-end
        web developer may be the talent you need to get your next web project off the ground.</P>
    <h2> Skills Required for Web Development</h2>

    <h3> HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's one of the key elements of a website. Being a front-end language,
        it provides the basic framework of a website, primarily through a series of tags.</p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. It sets the style behind the HTML structure and brings life to the website's
        appearance. Without CSS, the web page would look dull. </p>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <P>JavaScript allows you to add and implement various elements on the web pages. Features like interactive maps,
        2D/3D graphics can be added to a website using JavaScript.</P>

    <h3>Application Programming Interface (API)></h3>
    <p> In web development, you will have to work a great deal with APIs, which essentially manage the third-party data.
        It permits web developers to use some of the functionalities without sharing the code. </p>
    <h3> Authentication </h3>
    <p> There is a possibility that you will be managing user authentication to track the users on a particular site.
        For instance, permitting the users to sign in, log out or perform some actions from their accounts or blocking a
        few pages for the users who are not signed in.

        User's account security intensely relies upon authentication. So it's essential to know how to manage this
        functionality in your web applicatio </p>
    <h3> Back-end and Databases </h3>
    <p> Once you master the front-end, you need to proceed and take care of what is going on in the back-end. This is
        where all the magic happens, and this is where all the data is stored.

        Data is stored, manipulated, and retrieved from the databases. Nowadays, we often use cloud frameworks like
        Azure or AWS to keep the database. What you need to learn is how to manage data in a database.

        For this, you need to know either SQL (Structured Query Language) or NoSQL (used by MongoDB and Firebase). </p>
